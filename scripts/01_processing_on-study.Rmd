This script reads in the schedule spreadsheet for the BE WELL study, processes and writes a uniform RDS object in long format.

```{r cars}
x <- readxl::read_xlsx(file.path(paths$box, 
                                 "participants", 
                                 "Be Well Study Schedule.xlsx"),
                       skip = 1, trim_ws = TRUE)

head(x)
```

```{r}
xs <- 
  x %>%
  select(`Subject ID`, `Consented date`, `Visit 1`, `Redoing V1`, `Visit 2`, `Visit 3`, `Redoing V3`, `Visit 4`)

summary(xs)
```

```{r}
xsl <- 
  xs %>%
  gather(-`Subject ID`, key = "event", value = "date")
```

```{r}
saveRDS(xsl, file.path(paths$derived, "study-dates.RDS"))
```
