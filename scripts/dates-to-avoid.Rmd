The purpose of this script is to identify when to avoid scheduling a BEWELL Study visit 1 such that future visits do not fall on holidays. 


# Setup

Define the dates to avoid and the number weeks from that date

```{r}
dates <- c("2020-11-25", "2020-11-26", "2020-11-27", "2020-12-23", "2020-12-24", "2020-12-25", "2020-12-31", "2021-01-01")

ddates <- lapply(dates, as.Date)

weeks <- c(4, 6, 10)
```

# Calculate

Subtract the weeks from the holidays and dates neighborhing holidays.

```{r}
avoid <- lapply(ddates, function(x) x - weeks(weeks)) %>%
  unlist %>%
  as.Date(., origin = "1970-01-01")

avoid
```

# Combine and list

```{r}
avoid.all <- c(as.numeric(ddates), avoid) %>%
  sort 

avoid.all %>%
  as.Date(., origin = "1970-01-01")
```
